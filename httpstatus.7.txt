NAME
     httpstatus	 HTTP status codes

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the HTTP status codes commonly issued by a web
     server in response to a client request.  The status codes in this manual
     page are based on the information found in RFC7231 unless otherwise
     noted.

     HTTP status codes fall into one of five classes, identified by the first
     digit as follows:

     1xx (Informational)
	 The request was received, continuing process.

     2xx (Successful)
	 The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.

     3xx (Redirection)
	 Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request.

     4xx (Client Error)
	 The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.

     5xx (Server Error)
	 The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.

1xx STATUS CODES
     100 Continue
	 The server has received the initial part of the request and the
	 client should proceed to send the remainder.

     101 Switching Protocols
	 The server agrees to the clients request to switch protocols via the
	 RFC7230 "Upgrade" header.

     102 Processing
	 The server has has accepted the complete request, but has not yet
	 completed it.	(WebDAV; RFC2518)

     103 Early Hints
	 The server is likely to send a final response with the header fields
	 included in the informational response.  (RFC8297)

2xx STATUS CODES
     200 Ok
	 The request has succeeded.

     201 Created
	 The request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new
	 resources being created.

     202 Accepted
	 The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has
	 not been completed.

     203 NonAuthoritative Information
	 The request was successful but the enclosed payload has been modified
	 from that of the origin servers 200 (OK) response by a transforming
	 proxy.

     204 No Content
	 The server has successfully fulfilled the request; there is no addi
	 tional content to send in the response payload body.

     205 Reset Content
	 The server has fulfilled the request; the client should reset its
	 document view.

     206 Partial Content
	 The server is successfully fulfilling a range request for the target
	 resource based on the clients "Range" header. (RFC7233)

     207 MultiStatus
	 Multiple resources were to be affected by the COPY, but errors on
	 some of them prevented the operation from taking place. (WebDAV;
	 RFC4918)

     208 Already Reported
	 Indicates that members of multiple bindings from a previous multi
	 status response are not repeated.  (WebDAV; RFC5842)

     226 IM Used
	 The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the
	 response is a representation of the result of one or more instance
	 manipulations applied to the current instance.	 (RFC3229)

3xx STATUS CODES
     300 Multiple Choices
	 The target resource has more than one representation which the client
	 may choose from via Content Negotiation.

     301 Moved Permanently
	 The target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any
	 future references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed
	 URIs.

     302 Found
	 The target resource resides temporarily under a different URI.

     303 See Other
	 The server is redirecting the user agent to a different resource, as
	 indicated by a URI in the Location header field.

     304 Not Modified
	 A conditional GET or HEAD request has been received and would have
	 resulted in a 200 (OK) response if it were not for the fact that the
	 condition evaluated to false.	(RFC7232)

     305 Use Proxy
	 The requested resource MUST be accessed through the proxy given by
	 the Location field. (RFC2616) Deprecated due to security concerns
	 regarding inband configuration of a proxy.

     306 Switch Proxy
	 No longer used.  Originally generated by a proxy server to indicate
	 that the client or proxy should use the information in the accompany
	 ing Set proxy header to choose a proxy for subsequent requests.

     307 Temporary Redirect
	 The target resource resides temporarily under a different URI and the
	 user agent MUST NOT change the request method if it performs an auto
	 matic redirection to that URI.

     308 Permanent Redirect
	 The target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any
	 future references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed
	 URIs.	(RFC7538)

4xx STATUS CODES
     400 Bad Request
	 The server cannot or will not process the request due to something
	 that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syn
	 tax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).

     401 Unauthorized
	 The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentica
	 tion credentials for the target resource.

     402 Payment Required
	 Reserved for future use.

     403 Forbidden
	 The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.

     404 Not Found
	 The origin server did not find a current representation for the tar
	 get resource or is not willing to disclose that one exists.

     405 Method Not Allowed
	 The method received in the requestline is known by the origin server
	 but not supported by the target resource.

     406 Not Acceptable
	 The target resource does not have a current representation that would
	 be acceptable to the user agent, such as due to the clients "Accept"
	 header.

     407 Proxy Authentication Required
	 The client needs to authenticate itself in order to use a proxy.
	 (RFC7235)

     408 Request Timeout
	 The server did not receive a complete request message within the time
	 that it was prepared to wait.

     409 Conflict
	 The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current
	 state of the target resource.

     410 Gone
	 Access to the target resource is no longer available at the origin
	 server; this condition is likely to be permanent.

     411 Length Required
	 The server refuses to accept the request without a defined Content
	 Length.

     412 Precondition Failed
	 One or more conditions given in the request header fields evaluated
	 to false when tested on the server.  (RFC7232)

     413 Payload Too Large
	 The server is refusing to process a request because the request pay
	 load is larger than the server is willing or able to process.

     414 URI Too Long
	 The server is refusing to service the request because the request
	 target is longer than the server is willing to interpret.

     415 Unsupported Media Type
	 The origin server is refusing to service the request because the pay
	 load is in a format not supported by this method on the target
	 resource.

     416 Range Not Satisfiable
	 None of the ranges in the requests Range header field overlap the
	 current extent of the selected resource or the set of ranges
	 requested has been rejected due to invalid ranges or an excessive
	 request of small or overlapping ranges.  (RFC7233)

     417 Expectation Failed
	 The expectation given in the requests Expect header field could not
	 be met by at least one of the inbound servers.

     418 Im a teapot
	 An attempt to brew coffee was made, even though the target is a
	 teapot.  (RFC2324)

     421 Misdirected Request
	 The request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a
	 response.  (RFC7540)

     422 Unprocessable Entity
	 The server understands the content type of the request entity and the
	 syntax of the request entity is correct, but was unable to process
	 the contained instructions.  (WebDAV; RFC4918)

     423 Locked
	 The source or destination resource of a method is locked.  (WebDAV;
	 RFC4918)

     424 Failed Dependency
	 The method could not be performed on the resource because the
	 requested action depended on another action and that action failed.
	 (WebDAV; RFC4918)

     425 Too Early
	 The server is unwilling to risk processing a request that might be
	 replayed.  (RFC8470)

     426 Upgrade Required
	 The server refuses to perform the request using the current protocol
	 but might be willing to do so after the client upgrades to a differ
	 ent protocol.

     428 Precondition Required
	 The origin server requires the request to be conditional.  (RFC6585)

     429 Too Many Requests
	 The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time.
	 (RFC6585)

     431 Request Header Fields Too Large
	 The server is unwilling to process the request because its header
	 fields are too large.	(RFC6585)

     451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons
	 The server is denying access to the resource as a consequence of a
	 legal demand.	(RFC7725) Named after Ray Bradburys "Fahrenheit 451".

5xx STATUS CODES
     500 Internal Server Error
	 The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from
	 fulfilling the request.

     501 Not Implemented
	 The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the
	 request.

     502 Bad Gateway
	 The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid
	 response from an inbound server it accessed while attempting to ful
	 fill the request.

     503 Service Unavailable
	 The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a tempo
	 rary overload or scheduled maintenance, which will likely be allevi
	 ated after some delay.

     504 Gateway Timeout
	 The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a
	 timely response from an upstream server it needed to access in order
	 to complete the request.

     505 HTTP Version Not Supported
	 The server does not support, or refuses to support, the major version
	 of HTTP that was used in the request message.

     506 Variant Also Negotiates
	 The servers chosen variant resource is configured to engage in
	 transparent content negotiation itself, and is therefore not a proper
	 end point in the negotiation process.	(RFC2295)

     507 Insufficient Storage
	 The method could not be performed on the resource because the server
	 is unable to store the representation needed to successfully complete
	 the request.  (WebDAV; RFC4918)

     508 Loop Detected
	 The server terminated an operation because it encountered an infinite
	 loop while processing a request with "Depth: infinity".  (WebDAV;
	 RFC5842)

     510 Not Extended
	 The policy for accessing the resource has not been met in the
	 request.  (RFC2774)

     511 Network Authentication Required
	 The client needs to authenticate to gain network access.  (RFC6585)
